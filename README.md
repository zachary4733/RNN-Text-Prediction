RNN Text Prediction
This project demonstrates how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for text prediction using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained on sequential text data to predict the next character in a given sequence.

📌 Features
✅ Uses an RNN-based model for text prediction
✅ Implements LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) to handle long-term dependencies
✅ Trained on sample text data for demonstration
✅ Written in a Jupyter Notebook for easy execution
