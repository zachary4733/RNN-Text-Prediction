RNN Text Prediction
This project demonstrates how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for text prediction using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained on sequential text data to predict the next character in a given sequence.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Uses an RNN-based model for text prediction
âœ… Implements LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) to handle long-term dependencies
âœ… Trained on sample text data for demonstration
âœ… Written in a Jupyter Notebook for easy execution
